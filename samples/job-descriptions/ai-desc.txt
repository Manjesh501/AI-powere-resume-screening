We’re seeking AI Solution Engineers at all levels who combine strong software engineering acumen with first-principles thinking — people who are relentlessly curious, deeply analytical, and driven to create what’s never been built before.

 

What you’ll do

·      Design and build AI-powered enterprise solutions that connect and simplify complex systems.

·      Work hands-on with LLMs, Knowledge Graphs, Machine Learning, and Generative AI.

·      Turn ideas and prototypes into scalable, production-grade systems that create real business impact.

·      Collaborate with a cross-functional team combining computer science, enterprise architecture, and applied AI expertise.

 

What we’re looking for

·       Solid engineering fundamentals (Python, Java, or .NET).

·       Understanding of data systems, APIs, or ML/AI pipelines.

·       The ability to think and build from first principles, not just follow patterns.

·       A mindset driven by curiosity, creativity, and persistence — you love turning deep ideas into real products.



Nice to Have:

·      Experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, or GCP).

·      Familiarity with vector databases, LangChain, or MLOps tools.

·      Exposure to enterprise integration or data orchestration frameworks.
